She is a data science major at the University of San Francisco and a firm believer of democratizing the technological arena. She seeks to empower others by introducing easy, yet powerful computer science concepts to real world problems. In her free time, Elia enjoys scavenging the internet for new music, attending art shows, and field trips to the supermarket.
